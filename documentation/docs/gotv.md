# :material-filmstrip: GOTV & Demos {: #gotv }

Get5 can be configured to automatically record matches. This is enabled by default based on the state
of [`get5_demo_name_format`](../configuration/#get5_demo_name_format) and can be disabled by setting that parameter to
an empty string.

Demo recording starts once all teams have readied up and ends shortly following a map result. When a demo file is
written to disk, the [`Get5_OnDemoFinished`](events_and_forwards.md) forward is called, which you can use to move the
file or upload it somewhere. The filename can also be found in the map-section of the
[KeyValue stats system](../stats_system/#keyvalue).

Get5 will automatically adjust the [`mp_match_restart_delay`](https://totalcsgo.com/command/mpmatchrestartdelay) when a
map ends if GOTV is enabled to ensure that it won't be shorter than what is required for the GOTV broadcast to finish.
Players will also not be [kicked from the server](../configuration/#get5_kick_when_no_match_loaded) before this delay
has passed.

!!! warning "Don't mess too much with the TV! :tv:"

    Changing `tv_delay` or `tv_enable` in `warmup.cfg`, `live.cfg` etc. is going to cause problems with your demos.
    We recommend you set `tv_delay` either on your server in general or only once in the `cvars` section of your
    [match configuration](../match_schema). You should also not set `tv_delaymapchange` as Get5 handles this
    automatically.
    
    We recommend that you **do not** set `tv_enable` in your match configuration, as it **requires** a map change for
    the GOTV bot to join the server. You should enable GOTV in your general server config and refrain from turning it on
    and off with Get5. Note that setting `tv_enable 1` won't allow people to join your server's GOTV. You must also set
    `tv_advertise_watchable 1`, so you don't have to worry about ghosting if this is disabled.

### Automatic Uploads {: #upload }
If you have configured [`get5_demo_upload_url`](../configuration/#get5_demo_upload_url), 
[`get5_demo_upload_header_key`](../configuration/#get5_demo_upload_header_key) and
[`get5_demo_upload_header_value`](../configuration/#get5_demo_upload_header_value), Get5 will
automatically upload the demo file to the given URL. You can also set
[`get5_demo_delete_after_upload`](../configuration/#get5_demo_delete_after_upload)
in order to delete the file from the game server after successful upload.
