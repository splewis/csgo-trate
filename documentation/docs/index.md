# :material-text: Welcome to Get5

Get5 is a standalone SourceMod plugin for CS:GO servers for running matches. It was originally based
on [PugSetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) and inspired by [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO).

The core idea behind Get5 is to encapsulate all match details in a [single configuration file](./match_schema).
Its main target use-case is tournaments and leagues (online or LAN). All that is required of server-admins is to load
match config file to the server and the match should run without any additional interference. This plugin is not
invasive - most of its functionality is built to work within how the CS:GO server normally operates without changing its
functionality.

Highlights of Get5 include:

- [Locking players to their correct team and side by their Steam ID](./match_schema)
- Automatically setting team names/logos/match text values for spectator/GOTV clients
- [In-game map-selection](./veto) support from the match's list of maps
- Support for multi-map series (Bo1, Bo2, Bo3, Bo5, etc.)
- Warmup and [`!ready`](./commands#ready)-system for each team
- [Automatic GOTV demo recording](./gotv)
- [Advanced backup system](./backup) built on top of Valve's backup system
- Knifing for sides
- [Advanced pausing](./pausing) support
- [Coaching](./coaching) support
- Lightweight usage for [scrims](./getting_started#scrims)
- [Event logging and SourceMod forwards](./events_and_forwards) you can interface with, allowing for collection of
  stats etc.
- [Commands](./commands#serveradmin-commands) allow remote management of the plugin

To install Get5 on your CS:GO server, please see the [Installation](./installation) instructions.
