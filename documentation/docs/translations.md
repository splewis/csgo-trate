# :material-translate: Translations

Get5 has been translated into a few languages, but some a are still incomplete or could use a grammatical hand. If you
are proficient in a language other than English, you are welcome to open a pull request on GitHub with adjustments or
even entirely new languages. Note that you should be **good** at the language; machine-translations or sloppy
linguistics are worse than defaulting Get5 to English. If you cannot code and have found errors in translations, feel
free to join the [Discord](../community/#discord) and let us know.

## How to translate?

Inside the `translations` folder you will find the base `get5.phrases.txt` file which is the English one and the
fallback in case a translation string cannot be found in a client's language. This is the _single source of truth_ and
should be used when translating. Each language has a folder (for instance `fr` for french) within which there is
another `get5.phrases.txt` file, but in French.

Inside each file, the same language specifier is used in front of each string, which **must be identical throughout the
entire language file**.

## Example

!!! example "translations/get5.phrases.txt"

    ```yaml
    "TeamPickedMapInfoMessage"
    {
        "#format"  "{1:s},{2:s},{3:d}" # (1)
        "en"       "{1} picked {2} as map {3}." # (2)
    }
    ```

    1. The `#format` parameter indicates the order and types of parameters. These will *not* be defined in other 
       languages, and you should only provide the language string itself (with its language prefix, i.e. `en`). The
       original file indicates what `{1}`, `{2}` and `{3}` are. In this case, the first and second arguments are strings
       and the third is a number.
    2. Use the English strings and the [reference](#reference) below to determine how to translate the string.

As the string implies, this example is used when a team picks a map, and the output is printed to chat and looks like
this: `Team A picked de_dust2 as map 2.` The French translation file for this string looks like this:

!!! example "translations/fr/get5.phrases.txt"

    ```yaml
    "TeamPickedMapInfoMessage"
    {
        "fr"  "{1} a choisi {2} comme map {3}."
    }
    ```

## Types of strings

####`Chat`

:   Displayed in the regular game chat. This is the only type that supports
[color modifiers](../configuration#color-substitutes). You should use the same colors in the same lexical context as the
English translation. All injected variables are colored automatically if required.

####`HintText`

:   Displayed as a ["hint"](https://sourcemod.dev/#/halflife/function.PrintHintText) in the lower center of the screen,
where you would also see the pause or restart alert.

####`KickedNote`

:   Displayed as a modal in the middle of the CS:GO menu after you have been removed from the server. These must **not**
end with a full stop as this is added automatically.

####`Menu`

:   Displayed as an in-game menu where you select/browse using the numbers on your keyboard.

## String Reference {: #reference }

!!! warning

    Some translations are used as sentence components. These are exemplified in **bold**, in
    which case you are only expected to provide the bolded part of the sentence in the translation string.
    _Cursive_ text indicates an injected variable.
