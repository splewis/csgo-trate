# :material-help-network-outline: Community & Support

## :fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord {: #discord}

A Discord server is available for general support for Get5 (and other [splewis plugins](https://github.com/splewis)).
If you have suggestions or feedback you are welcome to join.

[:material-connection: Join Discord](https://discord.gg/zmqEa4keCk){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

!!! info "No such thing as a free lunch"

    The Discord server is **not** a place to ask for general support with regards to setting up a CS:GO server or
    getting help with other plugins that we have nothing to do with.

## :material-github: GitHub {: #github }

If you can code, you can help us over at [GitHub](https://github.com/splewis/get5). We're always looking for people to
fix issues or help test new features. We provide nightly releases of Get5 before official releases.

## :material-translate: Localization {: #localization }

If you speak a language that Get5 has not been translated into, or if you want to fix poor grammar or inconsistencies in
current translations, you can join the Discord and let us know what's supposed to be changed. If you want to contribute
yourself, take a look at the [translations](../translations) section.
