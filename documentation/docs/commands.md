# :material-apple-keyboard-command: Commands

Generally admin commands will have a `get5_` prefix and must be used in console. Commands intended for general player
usage are created with `sm_` prefixes, which means SourceMod automatically registers a `!` and `.` chat version of the
command. (For example: `sm_ready` in console is equivalent to `!ready` or `.ready` in chat).

## Client Commands

Please note that these can be typed by *all players* in chat.

####`!ready`

:   Marks the player as ready.

####`!unready`

:   Marks the player as not ready.

####`!pause` or `!tac` {: #pause }

:   Requests a [tactical pause](../pausing/#tactical).

####`!unpause`

:   Requests to unpause the game.

####`!tech`

:   Requests a [technical pause](../pausing/#technical).

####`!coach`

:   Moves a client to coach for their team. Requires that
the [`sv_coaching_enabled`](https://totalcsgo.com/command/svcoachingenabled) variable is set to `1`.

####`!stay`

:   Elects to stay after a knife round win. This can be substituted by `!ct` or `!t` to select a side.

####`!swap` or `!switch` {: #swap }

:   Elects to swap team side after a knife round win. This can be substituted by `!ct` or `!t` to select a side.

####`!stop`

:   Asks to reload the last match backup file. The opposing team must confirm. Only works if
the [backup system is enabled](../configuration/#get5_backup_system_enabled) and
the [get5_stop_command_enabled](../configuration/#get5_stop_command_enabled) is set to `1`.

####`!forceready`

:   Force-readies your team, marking all players on your team as ready.

####`!ringer`

:   Adds/removes a ringer to/from the home scrim team.

####`!scrim`

:   Shortcut for [`get5_scrim`](#get5_scrim).

####`!get5`

:   Opens a menu that wraps some common commands. It's mostly intended for people using scrim settings, and has
menu buttons for starting a scrim, force-starting, force-ending, adding a ringer, and loading the most recent backup
file.

## Server/Admin Commands

Please note that these are meant to be used by *admins* in console.

####`get5_loadmatch <filename>` {: #get5_loadmatch }

:   Loads a [match configuration](../match_schema) file (JSON or KeyValue) relative from the `csgo` directory.

####`get5_loadbackup <filename>` {: #get5_loadbackup }
:   Loads a match backup, relative from the `csgo`
directory. Only works if the [backup system is enabled](../configuration/#get5_backup_system_enabled). If you define
[`get5_backup_path`](../configuration/#get5_backup_path), you must include the path in the filename.

####`get5_last_backup_file`
:   Prints the name of the last match backup file Get5 wrote in the current series, this is automatically updated each
time a backup file is written. Empty string if no backup was written.

####`get5_loadteam <team1|team2|spec> <filename>` {: #get5_loadteam }
:   Loads a [team section of a match configuration](../match_schema) from a file into a team relative from the `csgo`
directory. The file must contain a `Get5MatchTeam` object.

####`get5_loadmatch_url <url>` {: #get5_loadmatch_url }
:   Loads a remote (JSON-formatted) [match configuration](../match_schema) by sending an HTTP(S) `GET` to the given URL.
You should put the `url` argument inside quotation marks (`""`).

!!! warning "SteamWorks required"

    Loading remote matches requires the [SteamWorks](../installation/#steamworks) extension.

####`get5_endmatch [team1|team2]`
:   Force-ends the current match. The team argument will force the winner of the series and the current map to be set
to that team. Omitting the team argument sets no winner (tie).

####`get5_creatematch [map name] [matchid]` {: #get5_creatematch }
:   Creates a BO1 match with the current players on the server. `map name` defaults to the current map and `matchid`
    defaults to `manual`. You should **not** provide a match ID if you use the [MySQL extension](../stats_system/#mysql).

####`get5_scrim [opposing team name] [map name] [matchid]` {: #get5_scrim }
:   Creates a [scrim](../getting_started/#scrims) on the current map. The opposing team name defaults to `Away`
    and the map defaults to the current map. `matchid` defaults to `scrim`. You should **not** provide a match ID if
    you use the [MySQL extension](../stats_system/#mysql).

####`get5_addplayer <auth> <team1|team2|spec> [name]` {: #get5_addplayer }
:   Adds a Steam ID to a team (can be any format for the Steam ID). The name parameter optionally locks the player's
name.

####`get5_addcoach <auth> <team1|team2> [name]` {: #get5_addcoach }
:   Adds a Steam ID to a team as a coach. The name parameter optionally locks the player's
name.

####`get5_removeplayer <auth>`
:   Removes a steam ID from all teams (can be any format for the Steam ID).

####`get5_addkickedplayer <team1|team2|spec> [name]` {: #get5_addkickedplayer }
:   Adds the last kicked Steam ID to a team. The name parameter optionally locks the player's name.

####`get5_removekickedplayer <team1|team2|spec>` {: #get5_removekickedplayer }
:   Removes the last kicked Steam ID from all teams. Cannot be used in scrim mode.

####`get5_forceready`
:   Marks all teams as ready. `get5_forcestart` does the same thing.

####`get5_status`
:   Replies with JSON formatted match state (available to all clients).

??? abstract "Definition"

    :warning: Properties marked as `undefined` are only present if a match configuration has been loaded.

    ```typescript
    interface StatusTeam {
        "name": string, // (11)
        "series_score": number, // (12)
        "current_map_score": number, // (13)
        "connected_clients": number, // (14)
        "ready": boolean, // (15)
        "side": "t" | "ct" // (16)
    }
    
    interface Status {
        "plugin_version": string, // (1)
        "gamestate": "none" | "pre_veto" | "veto" | "warmup"
            | "knife" | "waiting_for_knife_decision"
            | "going_live" | "live" | "post_game", // (2)
        "paused": boolean, // (3)
        "loaded_config_file": string | undefined, // (4)
        "matchid": string | undefined, // (5)
        "map_number": number | undefined, // (6)
        "round_number": number | undefined, // (7)
        "round_time": number | undefined, // (8)
        "team1": StatusTeam | undefined, // (9),
        "team2": StatusTeam | undefined, // (10)
        "maps": [string] | undefined // (17)
    }
    ```

    1. The version of Get5 you are currently running, along with that version's commit. `Example: "0.8.1-8ef7ffa3"`
    2. The current state of the game. The definition lists them in the order they occur.
    3. Whether the game is currently paused.
    4. The match configuration file currently loaded. `Example: "addons/sourcemod/configs/get5/match_config.json"`.
    5. The current match ID. Empty string if not defined or `scrim` or `manual` if using
       [`get5_scrim`](../commands/#get5_scrim) or [`get5_creatematch`](../commands/#get5_creatematch).
    6. The current map number, starting at `0`. You can use this to determine the current map by looking at the `maps`
       array.
    7. The current round number, starting at `0`. `-1` if `gamestate` is not `live`.
    8. The number of milliseconds elapsed in the current round.
    9. Describes `team1`.
    10. Describes `team2`.
    11. The name of the team.
    12. The current series score; the number of maps won.
    13. The number of rounds won on the current map.
    14. The number of currently connected players.
    15. Whether the team is [`!ready`](../commands/#ready).
    16. The side the team is currently on.
    17. The maps to be played in the series, i.e. `["de_dust2", "de_mirage", "de_nuke"]`. Maps are played in the order they
        appear in this array. `map_number` is the array index of the current map. **Note:** `maps` is only present if the
        maps have been decided (i.e. after `veto`).
