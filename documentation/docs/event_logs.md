# Event Logs
Get5 contains an event-logging system that logs many client actions and what is happening in the game. These supplement the logs CS:GO does on its own, but adds additional information about the ongoing match.

An `event` is a json object that looks something like this:
```json
{
    "matchid": "1",
    "event": "series_start",
    "params": {
        "team1_name": "EnvyUs",
        "team2_name": "Fnatic"
    }
}
```

Events will have variable parameters depending on what type of event it is. In the example, we see the event name is "series_start". All events include the "matchid" field and have a name under `event`.

## Interfacing With Events
From a plugin, you can use the `void Get5_OnEvent(const char[] eventJson)` forward to do anything you like with Get5 events.  
You can also use the builtin server `logaddress_add` command to add a server `ip:port` that is listening to the game server log and reading events (it could also read plain CS:GO server log lines - this is what [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO) does).

Finally, event can be logged to a file by settting the [`get5_event_log_format`](./get5_configuration.md#file-name-formatting) cvar. The file will look something like this:
```log
L 11/26/2016 - 02:58:39: {
    "matchid": "example_match",
    "event": "series_start",
    "params": {
        "team1_name": "EnvyUs",
        "team2_name": "Fnatic"
    }
}
```
You'd have to do some processing to handle parsing the logging timestamp before each json event, but it isn't very hard (a simple regex replacement would be fine).

## List of Events and Their Params
Some rules are followed in these settings:

1. `Winner` is a match team, i.e. `team1` or `team2`
2. `team` is a match team, i.e. `team1` or `team2`
3. `side` is a CS team, i.e. `CT` or `T`
4. `map_number` is 0-indexed
5. `client` fields (`client`, `attacker`, `victim`, etc.) will use `%L` sourcemod formatting
6. `site` is `"A"` or `"B"`
