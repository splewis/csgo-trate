# Get5 Configuration
This config is auto-generated on first plugin run, then auto-executed on each plugin start. The file is located at `cfg/sourcemod/get5.cfg`. You can either set these in the aforementioned file, or in the `cvars` section of a match config. As mentioned in the [match schema](../match_schema#optional-values), that section will override all other settings. This section will be broken up into various sub-sections which explains each configuration value.

## Pausing
- `get5_max_pauses`: Maximum number of pauses a team can use, 0=unlimited.
- `get5_max_pause_time`: Maximum number of time the game can spend paused by a team, 0=unlimited.
- `get5_reset_pauses_each_half`: Whether pause limits are reset each halftime period (default 1).
- `get5_fixed_pause_time`: If non-zero, the fixed length all pauses will be. Adjusting this to non-zero this will use the in-game timeout counter.
- `get5_pausing_enabled`: Whether the `!pause` command is enabled to clients or not.
- `get5_allow_technical_pause`: Whether technical pauses (`!tech` command) are enabled (default 1).
- `get5_max_tech_pauses`: Number of technical pauses a team is allowed to have, 0=unlimited.
- `get5_tech_pause_time`: If non-zero, number of seconds before any team can call unpause without confirmation. 0=unlimited and both teams must confirm.
- `get5_pause_on_veto`: Pauses/Freezes players during the veto phase.

## File Name Formatting
*Note: for these, setting the cvar to an empty string ("") will disable the file writing entirely.*

- `get5_demo_name_format`: Format to name demo files in (default `{MATCHID}_map{MAPNUMBER}_{MAPNAME}`).
- `get5_event_log_format`: Format to write get5 event logs to (default `logs/get5_match{MATCHID}.log`).
- `get5_stats_path_format`: Path where stats are output at each map end if it is set. Default `get5_matchstats_{MATCHID}.cfg`
