# :material-cog: Configuration

This is a list of all the configuration parameters you can set that change how Get5 behaves.

### The Main Config File {: #main-config }

The config file is auto-generated on **first plugin run**, then auto-executed on each plugin start. The file is located
here:

```yaml
cfg/sourcemod/get5.cfg
```

You can either set the below parameters in that file, or in the `cvars` section of a match config. As mentioned in
the explanation of the [match schema](../match_schema), that section will override all other settings.

### Phase Configuration Files

You should also have three config files. These can be edited, but we recommend not
blindly pasting another config in (e.g. ESL, CEVO). These must only include commands you would run in the console (such
as `mp_friendly_fire 1`) and should determine the rules for those three stage of your match. You can
also [point to other files](#config-files) by editing the main config file.

```yaml
cfg/get5/warmup.cfg # (1)
cfg/get5/knife.cfg # (2)
cfg/get5/live.cfg # (3)
```

1. Executed when the warmup/veto phase begins.
2. Executed when the knife-round starts.
3. Executed when the game goes live.

!!! danger "Prohibited options"

    You should avoid these commands in your live, knife and warmup configuration files, as all of these are handled by
    Get5 automatically. Introducing restarts, warmup changes or [GOTV](gotv.md) delay modifications can cause problems.
    If you want to set your `tv_delay` or `tv_delay1`, do it in the `cvars` section of your
    [match configuration](match_schema.md).

    ```
    mp_do_warmup_period
    mp_restartgame
    mp_warmup_end
    mp_warmup_pausetimer   
    mp_warmup_start
    mp_warmuptime
    mp_warmuptime_all_players_connected
    tv_delay
    tv_delay1
    tv_delaymapchange
    tv_enable
    tv_enable1
    tv_record
    tv_stoprecord
    ```

must call [`!unpause`](../commands/#unpause) to continue the match. This parameter is ignored
if [get5_fixed_pause_time](#get5_fixed_pause_time) is set to a non-zero
value. Set to zero to remove limit.<br>**`Default: 300`**

####`get5_fixed_pause_time`

## Backup System

####`get5_backup_system_enabled`

!!! warning "Slash, slash, hundred-yard dash :material-slash-forward:"

    It is very important that your backup path does **not** start with a slash but instead **ends with a slash**. If
    not, the last part of the path will be considered a prefix of the filename and things will not work correctly. Also
    note that if you use the [`{MATCHID}`](#tag-matchid) variable, [automatic deletion of backups](#get5_max_backup_age)
    does not work.

    :white_check_mark: `backups/`

    :white_check_mark: `backups/{MATCHID}/`

    :no_entry: `/backups/`

    :no_entry: `/backups/{MATCHID}`

####`get5_date_format`
:   Date format string. This determines the [`{DATE}`](#tag-date) tag.<br>**`Default: "%Y-%m-%d"`**

!!! danger "Advanced users only"

    Do not change the time format unless you know what you are doing. Please always include a component of hours,
    minutes and seconds in your `get5_time_format` so that [demo files](#get5_demo_name_format) will not be overwritten.
    You can find the reference for formatting a time string [here](https://cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/). The
    default example above prints time in this format: `2022-06-12_13-15-45`.

####`get5_event_log_format`
:   Format to write event logs to. Set to empty string to disable writing event logs.<br>**`Default: ""`**

####`get5_stats_path_format`
:   Path where stats are output on each map end. Set to empty string to
disable.<br>**`Default: "get5_matchstats_{MATCHID}.cfg"`**

####`get5_hostname_format`
:   The hostname to apply to the server when a match configuration is loaded.
[State substitutes](#state-substitutes) can be used. Leave blank to disable changing the hostname.<br>
**`Default: "Get5: {TEAM1} vs {TEAM2}"`**

####`get5_message_prefix`
:   The tag applied before plugin messages. Note that at least one character must come before
a [color modifier](#color-substitutes).<br>**`Default: "[{YELLOW}Get5{NORMAL}]"`**

####`get5_damageprint_format`
:   Formatting of damage reports in chat on round end. Ignored
if [`get5_print_damage`](#get5_print_damage) is disabled.<br>
**`Default: "- [{KILL_TO}] ({DMG_TO} in {HITS_TO}) to [{KILL_FROM}] ({DMG_FROM} in {HITS_FROM}) from {NAME} ({HEALTH} HP)"`**

!!! example "Damage report example"

    The default example above prints the following to chat on round end and includes information about kills, deaths,
    assists and flash assists.

    `{KILL_TO}` becomes a green `X` for a kill or a yellow `A` or `F` for assist or flash assist, respectively.

    `{KILL_FROM}` is similar to `{KILL_TO}`, but the `X` value is red (indicating a player killed you).

    No attribution replaces `{KILL_TO}` and/or `{KILL_FROM}` with a white dash: `-`.
    ```
    [Get5] Team A 1 - 0 Team B
    - [X] (100 in 3) to [A] (44 in 1) from Player1 (0 HP) # - Killed this player, they assisted in killing you.
    - [F] (0 in 0) to [X] (56 in 2) from Player2 (0 HP)   # - Killed by this player, flash assisted in killing them.
    - [-] (0 in 0) to [-] (0 in 0) from Player3 (84 HP)   # - No interaction, this player survived.
    - [A] (73 in 2) to [-] (0 in 0) from Player4 (0 HP)   # - Assisted in killing this player.
    - [-] (30 in 1) to [-] (0 in 0) from Player5 (0 HP)   # - Dealt damage to this player, not enough for assist.
    ```

## Config Files

####`get5_live_cfg`
:   Config file executed when the game goes live, relative to `csgo/cfg`.<br>**`Default: "get5/live.cfg"`**

####`get5_warmup_cfg`
:   Config file executed in warmup periods, relative to `csgo/cfg`.<br>**`Default: "get5/warmup.cfg"`**

####`get5_knife_cfg`
:   Config file executed for the knife round, relative to `csgo/cfg`.<br>**`Default: "get5/knife.cfg"`**

## Demos

####`get5_demo_upload_url`
:   If defined, Get5 will [automatically send a recorded demo](gotv.md#upload) to this URL in an HTTP `POST` request
once a recording stops. If no protocol is provided, `http://` will be prepended to this value. Requires the
[SteamWorks](../installation/#steamworks) extension.<br>**`Default: ""`**

####`get5_demo_upload_header_key`
:   If this **and** [`get5_demo_upload_header_value`](#get5_demo_upload_header_value) is defined, this header name and
value will be used for your [demo upload HTTP request](#get5_demo_upload_url).<br>**`Default: "Authorization"`**

####`get5_demo_upload_header_value`
:   If this **and** [`get5_demo_upload_header_key`](#get5_demo_upload_header_key) is defined, this header name and value
will be used for your [demo upload HTTP request](#get5_demo_upload_url).<br>**`Default: ""`**

####`get5_demo_delete_after_upload`
:   Whether to delete the demo file from the game server after
successfully [uploading it to a web server](gotv.md#upload).<br>**`Default: 0`**

####`get5_demo_path`
:   The folder of saved [demo files](../gotv#demos), relative to the `csgo` directory. You **can** use
the [`{MATCHID}`](#tag-matchid) and [`{DATE}`](#tag-date) variables, i.e. `demos/{DATE}/{MATCHID}/`.
Much like [`get5_backup_path`](#get5_backup_path), the path must **not** start with a slash, and
must **end with a slash**.<br>**`Default: ""`**

####`get5_demo_name_format`
:   Format to use for demo files when [recording matches](gotv.md#demos). Do not include a file extension (`.dem` is
added automatically). If you do not include the [`{TIME}`](#tag-time) tag, you will have problems with duplicate files
if restoring a game from a backup. Note that the [`{MAPNUMBER}`](#tag-mapnumber)variable is not zero-indexed. Set to
empty string to disable recording demos.<br>**`Default: "{TIME}_{MATCHID}_map{MAPNUMBER}_{MAPNAME}"`**

## Substitution Variables

### Match/State Substitutes {: #state-substitutes }

Various configuration parameters, such as the file format parameters or the `get5_hostname_format` option, take
placeholder strings that will be replaced by meaningful values when printed. Note that these are **case-sensitive**, so
`{Mapname}` would not work.

####`{TIME}` {: #tag-time}
:   The current time, determined by [`get5_time_format`](#get5_time_format).

### Colour Substitutes {: #color-substitutes }

These variables can be used to color text in the chat. You must return to `{NORMAL}` (white)
after using a color variable.

Example: `This text becomes {DARK_RED}red{NORMAL}, while {YELLOW}all of this will be yellow`.

- `{NORMAL}`
- `{DARK_RED}`
- `{PINK}`
- `{GREEN}`
- `{YELLOW}`
- `{LIGHT_GREEN}`
